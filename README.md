# luka.me

Personal portfolio website of Luka SaleviÄ‡, or the online moniker [Sensanaty](https://github.com/Sensanaty)

Built with Nuxt, hosted on Netlify.

## Tech Details

The project is built with Vue, with the initial setup done via @vue/cli.

It uses ESLint with the AirBNB config + Prettier for linting purposes.

The project majorly utilizes SCSS, compiled and bundled via node-sass. `modern-normalize.css` has also been selectively adjusted for the usecases of the site.

Netlify auto-fetches the `master` branch, so all changes pushed to `master` are treated as production ready.

## Contribution & Development

Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run `yarn dev` to run the webserver at port `3000` (default). It features all the goodies like HMR.

Netlify will automatically handle all deployments. It will auto-publish everything it finds under the `master` branch to the live version of the site. As such, the master branch should only feature merges of other feature branches to avoid an excessive number of redundant deployments.
